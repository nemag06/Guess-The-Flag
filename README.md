What I learned

* _I learned skills like data modeling, user input handling, and animations while working on the "Guess The Flag" project from "100 Days of SwiftUI". I also improved my design skills by creating a visually appealing user interface that is intuitive and easy to use. Additionally, I gained experience in sound effects and localization, which helped me create an engaging app that is accessible to users around the world. The project challenged me to think creatively and solve problems in new ways, which helped me develop my problem-solving skills and improve my overall proficiency in Swift programming and SwiftUI framework._
